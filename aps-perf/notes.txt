1. how to run simulation using gatling

setUp method: defined in abstract class Simulation.
takes a sequence of population builders

2. how is that during function works

the canonical example is to use scenario method and then start it using the following
call sequence:

setUp(scenario.inject(atOnceUsers(1))).protocols(httpProto)

so, core.Predef.scenario(scenarioName: String): ScenarioBuilder
so sequence of exec, pause etc still returns ScenarioBuilder
but inject call will return PopulationBuilder and that is exactly that we 
need to pass to setUp method

Predef.during(duration: Duration)(chain: ChainBuilder)
